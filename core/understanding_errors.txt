Programming models
  Automatic propagation (e.g. C++98 exceptions, P0709 exceptions without try statements)
  Manual propagation (e.g. error codes, expected, outcome)
  Hybrid propagation (errno, P0709 exceptions with try statements)
  Error accumulation (e.g. floating point NaN, monadic expected)
  Terminate

Implementation approaches
  Table unwinding
  Frame tracking
  Check before / after call
  Alternate return address

Implementation details
  Where to put the error object
  Re-throwing
  Reason for destructor call
  Stack usage
  Debugability (e.g. walking stack twice)
  Generalizability
  Choice of noexcept / throws defaults.  opt-in vs. opt-out
  Error classification

Environments
  Space constrained (e.g. microcontrollers)
  Real-time
  Kernel
  Bare-metal
  GPU
  FPGA
  High throughput
  Low latency
  Consistent resource usage systems
  Unreliable networks
  Mobile, Desktop, Server, HPC
